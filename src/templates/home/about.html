    <p>
        Channelry helps online sellers manage their products across different marketplaces.
        This allows sellers to focus on building insanely great products to their customers.
        It's a long road ahead but we believe that if we 
        put our users first,
        a laser-focus on building a powerful product,
        and the determination to get our jobs done
        then the journey becomes an exciting one.
