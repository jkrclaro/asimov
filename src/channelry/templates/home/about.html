        <p>
            Channelry helps online sellers manage their products across different marketplaces
            which enables our users to focus more on delivering insanely great products to their customers.
            We've got a long road ahead but we believe that if we 
            put our users first,
            a laser-focus on building a powerful product
            and the belief that we can accomplish this mission
            then the journey becomes an exciting one.
