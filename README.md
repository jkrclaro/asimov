# Eniac

Web apps I've written all in one.

## Apps
- Podcast player

## Requirements

You'll need the following:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Modern browser like Google Chrome


## Getting started

Run the app locally using docker-compose

```sh-session
docker-compose up
```

Lastly, you will see the URL can be visited in

```
localhost:3000
```

Use this URL in your browser to start the app.
